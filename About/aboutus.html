      <p1>For a decade now, 3D visualization has been working as a catalyst in many domains, especially architecture, manufacturing, product design& modeling and media & entertainment. As the industries are growing, so are their demands. 
        </p1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p2>One such sector that requires our attention is the education sector. It is a common belief that seeing is believing and believing is knowledge. As technology has started growing rapidly over the past many years, it has also decreased the affordability of such highly efficient resources. Applications that make use of augmented reality have sky-rocketing developmental costs which also decreases affordability. 
        </p2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p3>Our mission, with the help of Orgment It, is to impart such visualisation and the concept of realism in the domain of biology, which is affordable and highly user efficient. Such a visualization when coupled with augmented reality makes this application highly powerful and user friendly. 
        </p3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p4>Our application is built to increase the understanding of students and enhance peer-to-peer knowledge by efficiently gathering knowledge from all students and presenting it to the masses in a better format along with our detailed models.
